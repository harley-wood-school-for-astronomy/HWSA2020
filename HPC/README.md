# High-Performance Computing - Writing Parallel Code
### Manodeep Sinha

The goal for this session is to introduce you to the distributed programming paradigm. We will discuss the differences between writing sequential (or serial) code and parallel code, and work on an example parallel python code (using mpi4py). The key idea in this talk is to understand how to partition work into independent units and then use mpi4py to run the jobs in parallel.

Attendee pre-requesites:

* Familiar with good coding practices (see talks by Rebecca, Paul at this HWSA or HWSA 2019)
* Familiar with python programming

Software pre-requisites:
* python3.6+
* numpy
* matplotlib
* mpi4py
